#
# /etc/sudoers file created on installation of the sudo package
#
# mazinger package adds the following line:
# 
# 	#includedir /etc/mazinger/sudoers.d
# 
# This will cause sudo to read and parse any files in the /etc/mazinger/sudoers.d 
# directory that do not end in '~' or contain a '.' character
#
# Note that there must be at least one file in the sudoers.d directory (this
# one will do), and all files in this directory should be mode 0440.
